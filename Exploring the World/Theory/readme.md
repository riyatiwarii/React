## Q: What are `Microservices`?

Microservices were used to overcome the challenges of monolithic architecture that prevailed initially in the market and also enables you to deploy independent services.

So, before we move on to what is Microservices in simple words, let’s see the architecture that prevailed initially in the market i.e. the Monolithic Architecture.

In layman terms, you can say that its similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.
Many challenges stemmed from this architecture:

* Inflexible – Monolithic applications cannot be built using different technologies 
* Unreliable – Even if one feature of the system does not work, then the entire system does not work
* Unscalable – Applications cannot be scaled easily since each time the application needs to be updated, the complete system has to be rebuilt
* Blocks Continous Development – Many features of the applications cannot be built and deployed at the same time
* Not Fit For Complex Applications – Features of complex applications have tightly coupled dependencies

`Microservice Architecture` takes birth to overcome all these challenges. 
### What exactly is Microservices?
Microservice is a small, loosely coupled distributed service. It allows you to take a large application and decompose or break it into easily manageable small components with narrowly defined responsibilities. It is considered the building block of modern applications. Microservices can be written in a variety of programming languages, and frameworks, and each service acts as a mini-application on its own.
